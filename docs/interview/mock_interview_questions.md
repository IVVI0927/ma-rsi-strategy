# Mock Interview Questions & Answers - A-Share Quantitative Trading System

---

## **TECHNICAL QUESTIONS** (Mid-Level SWE)

### **Q1: Walk me through the system architecture of your quantitative trading system. Why did you choose FastAPI over Django or Flask?**

**Model Answer:**
*"I architected the system as a modular, microservices-ready application with clear separation of concerns. The core components include a FastAPI backend for APIs, a React frontend for visualization, a custom backtesting engine, and a multi-layer risk management system.*

*I chose FastAPI over Django or Flask for several reasons: First, performance - FastAPI is built on Starlette and uvicorn, giving us async capabilities that helped achieve our 2.3ms P95 latency target. Second, automatic API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger, which is crucial for institutional clients who need comprehensive API docs. Third, native async support was essential for processing multiple stocks simultaneously - we can analyze 20 stocks concurrently.*

*Django would have been overkill with its ORM and admin interface, and Flask would have required more boilerplate for the async operations. FastAPI's type hints and Pydantic integration also helped catch bugs early and improve code maintainability."*

---

### **Q2: How did you achieve sub-10ms API response times? What specific optimizations did you implement?**

**Model Answer:**
*"Achieving 2.3ms P95 latency required several optimization strategies:*

*First, **data access optimization** - I used direct CSV reading with pandas instead of a database for frequently accessed stock data, which eliminated network round trips. For production, this would be replaced with Redis caching.*

*Second, **async processing** - FastAPI's async capabilities let us handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently. I implemented parallel processing for stock analysis using ThreadPoolExecutor.*

*Third, **algorithmic efficiency** - I optimized the technical indicator calculations to avoid redundant computations. For example, RSI calculation reuses previous averages rather than recalculating from scratch.*

*Fourth, **memory management** - I implemented proper connection pooling and avoided memory leaks in the calculation loops.*

*The benchmarking showed our average response time was 1.5ms with zero errors across 50+ tests, significantly beating our 10ms target and the 100ms industry standard."*

---

### **Q3: Explain your risk management system. How do you ensure orders are validated correctly while maintaining low latency?**

**Model Answer:**
*"The risk management system implements six independent validation layers: position size limits, daily loss limits, drawdown controls, sector concentration, leverage limits, and market hours validation.*

*To maintain low latency, I designed a stateful validator that keeps portfolio state in memory and performs all calculations synchronously. The key optimizations include:*

*Pre-computed portfolio metrics that update incrementally rather than recalculating from scratch. Efficient data structures using Python dictionaries for O(1) lookups. Early termination - if any validation fails, we immediately return without running subsequent checks.*

*The benchmarking results were exceptional: 0.011ms average validation time across 1,000+ random orders, with 100% accuracy in risk detection. This is 4,500x faster than manual validation processes. The system correctly rejected invalid orders while maintaining sub-millisecond performance."*

---

### **Q4: How did you approach backtesting to ensure realistic results? What biases did you avoid?**

**Model Answer:**
*"I implemented a comprehensive backtesting framework with several bias prevention measures:*

*First, **look-ahead bias prevention** - signals are only generated using data available at that point in time. The backtesting engine processes data chronologically and never uses future information.*

*Second, **survivorship bias handling** - I backtested on the actual stocks available in our dataset, not just successful companies that survived to today.*

*Third, **realistic execution simulation** - incorporated transaction costs (0.03% commission), slippage (0.05%), and minimum lot sizes (100 shares for A-shares).*

*Fourth, **out-of-sample testing** - used 2023-2024 data that wasn't used for strategy development.*

*The results showed our fundamental strategy achieved 23.61% annual returns with a 2.70 Sharpe ratio across 20+ A-Share stocks. The system processed 153-1,099 trades per strategy, providing statistically significant results."*

### **Q5: How would you scale this system to handle ¥100 billion in assets under management?**

**Model Answer:**
*"Scaling to ¥100B AUM requires architectural changes in several areas:*

***Data Layer**: Migrate from CSV files to PostgreSQL with read replicas, implement Redis cluster for caching frequently accessed indicators, and use time-series databases like InfluxDB for price data.*

***Application Layer**: Decompose into microservices - separate services for data ingestion, signal generation, portfolio management, and order execution. Deploy on Kubernetes with horizontal pod autoscaling.*

***Processing**: Implement message queues (Kafka) for async processing, use Celery workers for background computations, and add circuit breakers for resilience.*

***Database**: Implement database sharding by stock symbol or date ranges, use connection pooling, and optimize queries with proper indexing.*

*Current benchmarks show we can handle ¥10B with existing architecture, so this represents a 10x scaling challenge that's definitely achievable with these architectural improvements."*

## **BEHAVIORAL QUESTIONS** (Mid-Level SWE)

### **Q6: Tell me about a time when you had to debug a performance issue in your trading system.**

**Model Answer:**
*"During the initial API benchmarking, I discovered that our recommendation endpoint was occasionally spiking to 100ms+ response times, far above our 10ms target.*

*I approached this systematically: First, I added detailed timing logs to each component. Then I ran focused benchmarks isolating different parts - data loading, computation, and response serialization.*

*The root cause was inefficient pandas operations in the technical indicator calculations - specifically, the RSI calculation was recalculating the entire moving average on each call instead of updating incrementally.*

*I refactored the calculation to use rolling window optimization and implemented caching for intermediate results. This reduced the P95 latency from 100ms+ to 4.1ms - a 25x improvement.*

*The key learning was the importance of profiling before optimizing and not making assumptions about bottlenecks."*

---

### **Q7: Describe a situation where you had to make a difficult technical decision with limited information.**

**Model Answer:**
*"When designing the data storage strategy, I had to choose between using a traditional database, staying with CSV files, or implementing a hybrid approach - all without knowing the exact production load patterns.*

*The constraints were: Need for fast reads during market hours, limited infrastructure budget, and uncertainty about data volumes. I had to make this decision early to avoid major refactoring later.*

*I decided on CSV files with a migration path to Redis caching, based on: Benchmarking showed CSV access was actually faster for our read-heavy workload, lower operational complexity for initial deployment, and clear upgrade path when we understand usage patterns better.*

*This proved correct - we achieved 2.3ms P95 latency, and the system is already designed for easy migration to Redis when we scale. Sometimes the simplest solution is the right starting point."*

---

### **Q8: How do you ensure code quality and reliability in a financial system where errors can be costly?**

**Model Answer:**
*"Financial systems require exceptional reliability, so I implemented multiple layers of quality assurance:*

***Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage, including unit tests for all calculations, integration tests for API endpoints, and end-to-end backtesting validation.*

***Validation**: All financial calculations have independent verification - for example, I manually verified Sharpe ratio calculations against Excel to ensure accuracy.*

***Error Handling**: Graceful failure modes with comprehensive logging. The risk management system defaults to rejecting orders when uncertain rather than allowing potentially dangerous trades.*

***Code Review**: Even working solo, I used systematic code review by documenting all major decisions and validating them against industry standards.*

*The results speak to this approach - zero errors across 1,000+ risk validation tests and 50+ API tests, with 100% accuracy in order rejection scenarios."*

---

### **Q9: Tell me about a time you had to learn a new technology quickly for this project.**

**Model Answer:**
*"I had limited experience with FastAPI when I started this project, having primarily worked with Flask previously.*

*The challenge was that I needed to leverage FastAPI's async capabilities to achieve the performance targets, but I had to learn the framework while building a production-quality system.*

*My approach was: Started with FastAPI documentation and built simple examples first, identified key differences from Flask (async/await, dependency injection, automatic docs), practiced with small API endpoints before building complex trading logic.*

*I also studied FastAPI's source code to understand performance characteristics and best practices.*

*The investment paid off - FastAPI's automatic documentation saved significant development time, and the async capabilities were crucial for achieving our 2.3ms latency target. I'm now comfortable recommending FastAPI for high-performance financial APIs."*

---

### **Q10: How do you stay current with both financial markets and software engineering best practices?**

**Model Answer:**
*"I maintain expertise in both domains through structured learning:*

***Financial Markets**: I follow quantitative finance journals, study factor models from academic research, and backtest new strategies on historical data. For A-Share markets specifically, I monitor CSRC regulations and Chinese market dynamics.*

***Software Engineering**: I contribute to open-source projects, follow engineering blogs (especially around performance optimization), and practice with new frameworks through side projects.*

***Integration**: The most valuable learning happens at the intersection - understanding how software architectural decisions impact trading performance, or how financial requirements drive technology choices.*

*For this project, this dual expertise was crucial - knowing that Chinese A-shares trade in lots of 100 influenced the order validation logic, while understanding async programming enabled the performance requirements."*

## **HR/BEHAVIORAL QUESTIONS** (Non-Technical Recruiter)

### **Q11: Tell me about this quantitative trading project and why it excites you.**

**Model Answer:**
*"This project combines two of my greatest interests - financial markets and technology - to solve real problems for investors.*

*What excites me most is the impact potential. Traditional wealth management in China is still very manual and expensive. Our system democratizes institutional-grade quantitative strategies, making sophisticated trading accessible to high-net-worth individuals.*

*The technical challenge was equally rewarding. Building a system that can analyze 20+ stocks in milliseconds while maintaining 100% risk management accuracy required deep optimization and careful architecture decisions.*

*But beyond the technology, I'm proud of the business results - our fundamental strategy generated 23.61% annual returns with excellent risk management. This isn't just a cool technical project; it's a solution that can genuinely help people grow their wealth more effectively.*

*Working at the intersection of finance and technology, solving complex problems that have measurable business impact - that's exactly the kind of work that energizes me."*

---

### **Q12: How do you handle working on complex projects with tight deadlines?**

**Model Answer:**
*"I break complex projects into manageable phases and maintain clear priorities throughout.*

*For the trading system, I organized work into phases: First, core backtesting functionality to validate the investment strategies. Then API development to make the system accessible. Finally, comprehensive testing and documentation.*

*I use systematic time management: Daily progress tracking, weekly milestone reviews, and honest assessment of what's achievable. When I realized the initial timeline was optimistic, I proactively communicated the tradeoffs rather than trying to cut corners.*

*The result was a system that exceeded performance targets - 2.3ms API latency vs 10ms goal, 2.70 Sharpe ratio indicating excellent risk-adjusted returns, and comprehensive documentation that would support a team environment.*

*I believe in 'slow is smooth, smooth is fast' - taking time to architect properly upfront prevented major refactoring later."*

---

### **Q13: Describe a time when you had to present technical work to a non-technical audience.**

**Model Answer:**
*"While developing the trading system, I created comprehensive business documentation to explain the technical achievements in business terms.*

*The challenge was translating metrics like 'P95 latency' and 'Sharpe ratios' into language that highlights business value.*

*I focused on outcomes rather than methods: Instead of '2.3ms API response time,' I said 'system responds 40x faster than industry standards, enabling real-time trading.' Instead of '2.70 Sharpe ratio,' I explained '23.61% annual returns with excellent risk management.'*

*I created visual comparisons showing our performance vs industry benchmarks, and translated technical capabilities into business benefits - like how sub-10ms response times enable high-frequency trading strategies that weren't previously possible.*

*The business impact analysis I created projects ¥39 million annual revenue with 25,000% ROI - numbers that clearly demonstrate the commercial value of the technical work.*

*The key is always starting with 'what does this mean for the business' rather than 'how does this work technically.'"*

---

### **Q14: What motivates you in your career, and how does this project align with your goals?**

**Model Answer:**
*"I'm motivated by building technology that has measurable impact on people's lives, especially at the intersection of finance and software engineering.*

*This project aligns perfectly because it addresses a real market need - China's ¥50 billion quantitative trading market is underserved by modern technology. Traditional wealth management is manual, expensive, and inconsistent.*

*What drives me is seeing technology solve complex problems elegantly. The fact that we achieved 4,500x faster risk validation than manual processes isn't just a technical achievement - it means better risk management for investors.*

*Long-term, I want to build financial technology that's both sophisticated and accessible. This project demonstrates that institutional-grade quantitative strategies can be delivered through modern software architecture to a broader market.*

*I'm particularly excited about working in environments where I can combine deep technical skills with business impact, where the software architecture decisions directly influence financial outcomes."*

---

### **Q15: How do you approach learning new skills, and what would you like to learn next?**

**Model Answer:**
*"I learn most effectively through hands-on projects with real constraints and measurable outcomes.*

*For this trading system, I needed to quickly master FastAPI, quantitative finance concepts, and Chinese A-Share market dynamics. My approach was: Start with official documentation and tutorials, build simple examples to understand core concepts, then apply to the real project with measurable goals.*

*I also believe in learning from multiple sources - combining academic papers on quantitative finance with engineering blogs on API optimization gave me a more complete picture.*

*Next, I'm excited to deepen my knowledge in several areas: Machine learning applications in finance, particularly reinforcement learning for portfolio optimization. Advanced system architecture for financial services, including real-time data processing at scale. Blockchain and DeFi protocols, as they're reshaping financial infrastructure.*
